#SNS Instrument files for Mcstas

To compile these instruments, the component files in the ../components driectory are required.

##ARCS_full.instr
A full model of the ARCS instrument[1]. It has a sample kernel that will provides n &#948; functions in energy transfer and 2&theta;, where n is a number of equally spaced points around the straight through beam.
The output of the simulation is a Nexus[2] file that can be read in Mantid [3].

##ARCS_full_sqw.instr
A full model of the ARCS instrument[1]. It contains the IstropicSqw kernel[4] in the sample position.  
With model3.sqw that will provide a model of the resolution for the He recoil line.
The output of the simulation is a Nexus[2] file that can be read in Mantid [3].
