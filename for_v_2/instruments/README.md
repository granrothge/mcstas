#SNS Instrument files for Mcstas

##ARCS_full.instr 
A full model of the ARCS instrument[ARCS]. It has a sample kernel that will provides n \delta functions in energy transfer and 2\theta, where n is a number of equally spaced points around the straight through beam. 
The output of the simulation is a Nexus[Nexus] file that can be read in Mantid [Mantid]. The ability to write Nexus files ready for Mantid is a relatively new feature so to run this simulation properly, you will need to use the current Mcstas development version rather than the release version.
